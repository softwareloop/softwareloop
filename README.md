### ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm a senior backend developer, working for [Urbi](http://urbi.co/), building services and
integrations for smart/green mobility. I'm specialised in Java, Kotlin, AWS, and Postgres.
I advocate automated testing for quality and productivity.

Although I enjoy all new technologies, you'll often find me refining the fundamentals of
professional software development: OO, TDD, DDD, and refactoring. 

I'm mathematically inclined. I'm fascinated by [Douglas Hoftstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter)'s
books and research, including the topic of analogies and analogy-making machines.
I'm interesting in optimisation and I'm a fond user of [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/).

I like engineering, anything from oil rigs to electric vehicles, and I'm glad when
solving an engineering problem is part of my job.

My current learning goal is getting a grip on the Rust programming language.
