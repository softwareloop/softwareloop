### ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm a senior backend developer, working for [Urbi](http://urbi.co/), building services and
integrations for smart/green mobility. I'm specialised in Java, Kotlin, AWS, and Postgres.
I advocate automated testing for quality and productivity.

Although I enjoy all new technologies, you'll often find me refining the fundamentals of
professional software development: OO, TDD, DDD, and refactoring. 

I'm fascinated by [Douglas Hoftstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter)'s
books and research, including the topic of analogies and analogy-making machines.
I'm interesting in optimisation and I'm a fond user of [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/).

I like engineering, anything from oil rigs to electric vehicles, and I'm glad when
solving an engineering problem is part of my job.

My current learning goal is getting a grip on the Rust programming language.

### ðŸšš My repos

Kotlin:

* [glo](https://github.com/softwareloop/glo): helps organising a library of game roms by looking up their hashes on public databases  

Java:

* [contacts-sync](https://github.com/softwareloop/contacts-sync): originally designed as a tool to sync Gmail and LinkedIn contacts, it has become a playground to learn OAuth
* [mybatis-generator-lombok-plugin](https://github.com/softwareloop/mybatis-generator-lombok-plugin): a plugin for MyBatis Generator to use Lombok annotations instead of getters and setters
* [tstconfig](https://github.com/softwareloop/tstconfig): a system administration tool for automatic configuration testing. This is an old idea/project. Today I would use Ansible.

Alfresco document management (I no longer work with it):

* [uploader-plus](https://github.com/softwareloop/uploader-plus): an enhanced file uploader that prompts for metadata. My most popular project, developed together with the great Alfresco community (thank you all).
* [alfresco-inboxes](https://github.com/softwareloop/alfresco-inboxes): an inbox plugin implemented using the Aikau framework
